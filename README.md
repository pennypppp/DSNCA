# DSNCA
This project utilizes 3D reconstruction for micro-expression recognition.
## Requirements
my computer platform
Ubuntu 20.04  
CuDNN 11.4
recommend env
* Python 3.7 (numpy, skimage, scipy, opencv)  
* PyTorch >= 1.6 (pytorch3d)   

## Usage
Preprocess the SMIC dataset to detect the apex frames.
smic_processing.py: Preprocess the SMIC dataset: detect the apex frames.

To reproduce the results in the log file, run the following scripts:
```bash
python train_me_loso.py
python get_result_log.py
```
The filenames of the code specifically represent the following:
* "baseline" in the filename indicates that the baseline code is being run.
* "casme" in the filename means that the code is trained on the CASME dataset. You can also run this code by simply changing the dataset name to SMIC if desired.
* "samm"  in the filename indicates that the code is trained on the SAMM dataset.
* "dual" in filename means dual stream
* "3d"   in the filename means that 3D reconstruction is being used..
* "composite"in the filename means using composite dataset which consists of the SMIC, SAMM, and CASME datasets
## 3D face reconstruction can eliminate obstacles such as glasses, thereby improving recognition accuracy

the frontal view of the 3D face reconstruction.
there is no glass and restored facial details.

## There is evidence that algorithms can focus more on high-information-value areas.

## The log file result
after you run the code,the result_log.csv will record the result,you will find it in a result filefolder
> `get_result_log.csv`.
